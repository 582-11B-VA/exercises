# Exercises: Basic data

Pair with another student, and try to create the images described below
in Pyret. Only one student (the _driver_) should write code and share
their screen. The other student (the _observer_) should review each line
of code and make suggestions. Switch roles at the halfway point.

- A blue triangle (you pick the size). As with `circle`, there is a
  `triangle` function that takes a side length, fill style, and color.
- A blue triangle inside a yellow rectangle.
- A triangle oriented at an angle.
- A bullseye with 3 nested circles aligned in their centers (like a
  target). Hint: the `overlay` function only takes two images, so you'll
  need to think about how to use composition to layer three circles.
