# Exercise: Higher-order functions

For this assignment, your task is to implement the following functions:

- A function named `list-to-upper` that transforms a given list of
  strings into uppercase. See the built-in [string-to-upper] function.

- A function named `list-items` that transforms a given list of strings
  into a list of HTML `<li>` elements.

- A function named `vowel-count` that returns the number of vowels in a
  given word. Note that if the separator given to `string-split-all` is
  an empty string, it explodes the original string into a list of
  characters.

- A function named `is-superset` that determines if all elements of a
  given list are included in a second given list.
