# Exercise: Functions

For this exercise, your task is to review the code you wrote for
exercise #2, and define functions for repeated operations. Here are some
clues:

- Most flags have stripes whose _color_ and _height_ can vary.
- Most flags are made of _three_ stripes stacked on top of each other.
  Unfortunately, the built-in `above` function only allows stacking
  _two_ stripes at a time.

In addition, define a function named `add-pole` that adds a flagpole to
any given flag.
