# Exercise: Booleans (cont.)

Annalyn is a brave girl with a fierce pet dog. Unfortunately, while she
and her friend Amiel are picking berries in the forest, Amiel is
kidnapped by bandits. After tracking the kidnappers, Annalyn finds the
camp where her friend is being held. The camp is guarded by two captors:
a knight and an archer.

Annalyn can try to sneak into the camp to free Amiel, but it's risky,
and she can only succeed in one of two ways:

- If Annalyn's dog attacks, she can rescue Amiel, but only if the archer
  is asleep. The knight is afraid of dogs, and the archer won't have
  time to react before Annalyn and Amiel escape.

- If the dog does not attack, Annalyn and Amiel must remain completely
  silent. Annalyn can free Amiel only if he is awake _and_ both captors
  are asleep. If Amiel is asleep, he might be startled when Annalyn
  suddenly appears and accidentally wake the knight and the archer.

Implement a function that determines whether Annalyn can free Amiel.
When called, the function will be given the following arguments:

- Whether or not Annalyn's dog is attacking,
- Whether or not the archer is awake.
- Whether or not the knight is awake.
- Whether or not Amiel is awake.
